# Traffic-Accident-Analytics
An interactive dashboard analyzing accident patterns across India (2021–2023). It highlights **300+ high-risk accident locations**, estimates hospital accessibility and emergency response times, and incorporates weekend/national holiday effects for better policy and resource planning.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents a **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes road accident trends across India. The dashboard consolidates accident data into interactive visuals to provide actionable insights into accident frequency, severity, demographics, weather influence, and hospital accessibility.  

The goal is to support **policy makers, traffic authorities, and emergency response teams** in identifying high-risk areas, understanding accident causes, and improving emergency preparedness.
